# About One-Stop Payroll

The One-Stop Payroll initiative is a joint effort by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB), the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Government Technology Agency (GovTech). The initiative aims to streamline and simplify the payroll process for businesses. 

Previously, businesses manually submitted similar information to agencies during different periods of the year. With One-Stop Payroll, businesses can submit employers’ employment and wage-related information to multiple agencies through their payroll software. This includes the annual submission of salary data (under Auto-Inclusion Scheme) to IRAS, monthly submission of employees’ CPF contributions to CPFB, and responses to the Occupational Employment Dataset and labour market surveys administered by MOM. As a result, this reduces administrative workload and encourages adherence to payroll-related regulatory obligations.
