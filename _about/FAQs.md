<h3><strong>One-Stop Payroll FAQs</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the One-Stop Payroll initiative? </strong>
<br>The One-Stop Payroll initiative is a joint effort by the Inland Revenue
Authority of Singapore (IRAS), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB),
the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Government Technology Agency (GovTech).
The initiative aims to streamline and simplify the payroll process for
businesses. Previously, businesses manually submitted similar information
to agencies during different periods of the year. With One-Stop Payroll,
businesses can submit employers’ employment and wage-related information
to multiple agencies through their payroll software. This includes the
annual submission of salary data (under Auto-Inclusion Scheme) to IRAS,
monthly submission of employees’ CPF contributions to CPFB, and responses
to the Occupational Employment Dataset and labour market surveys administered
by MOM. As a result, this reduces administrative workload and encourages
adherence to payroll-related regulatory obligations.

<li>
<p><strong>What are the key objectives of the One-Stop Payroll initiative? </strong>
<br>The main goals of the One-Stop Payroll initiative are to make payroll
processes easier and more consistent for businesses using payroll software,
reduce administrative workload, and encourage adherence to payroll-related
regulatory obligations. By consolidating payroll services into a single,
convenient “one-stop” platform, the initiative aims to boost operational
efficiency and help businesses and employers manage payroll more effectively.
<br>
</p>

<li>
<p><strong>How will the One-Stop Payroll initiative benefit businesses and employers? </strong>
<br>The One-Stop Payroll initiative offers several benefits for businesses
and employers. Firstly, it simplifies the process by integrating core filing
obligations within the payroll software that businesses already use, reducing
the time and effort needed to meet regulatory obligations. This also helps
to ensure greater accuracy and reduces the need for employers to reach
out to agencies for assistance. Additionally, it enables easy compliance
and has the potential to streamline filing frequencies to agencies in the
long term.

<p><strong>What is the product in the One-Stop Payroll initiative? </strong>
<br>CPFB, IRAS and MOM provide the following submission APIs on GovTech’s
centralised APEX platform, that are available to software developers and
partners for integration in their payroll software:</p>

income information electronically to IRAS under the Auto Inclusion Scheme
(AIS). This is to automatically include the income in employees’ personal

the AIS and send associated data (salary, bonus, CPF, etc.) to IRAS seamlessly.</p>

<p>Employers are required under the Statistics Act to report changes in their
workforce composition to MOM under the Occupational Employment Dataset
(OED), as well as complete quarterly Labour Market Surveys (LMS). This
API enables employers to report OED and LMS data directly from their payroll
software.</p>
