<h3><strong>One-Stop Payroll FAQs</strong></h3>

<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>What are the key objectives of the One-Stop Payroll initiative? </strong>
<br>The main goals of the One-Stop Payroll initiative are to make payroll-related
regulatory requirements easier and more consistent for businesses using
payroll software, thereby reducing administrative overheads. By integrating
these payroll-related regulatory requirements seamlessly into a single,
convenient “one-stop” platform within the payroll software’s natural systems,
the initiative aims to boost operational efficiency and help businesses
and employers manage payroll more effectively.</p>
<p>
<br>

<li>
<p><strong>How will the One-Stop Payroll initiative benefit businesses and employers? </strong>
<br>The One-Stop Payroll initiative simplifies the process by integrating
core filing obligations within the payroll software that businesses already
use, reducing the time and effort needed to meet regulatory obligations.
This also helps to ensure greater accuracy and reduces the need for employers
to reach out to agencies for assistance. Additionally, it enables easy
compliance and has the potential to streamline filing frequencies to agencies
in the long term.</p>
