<h3><strong>One-Stop Payroll FAQs</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the One-Stop Payroll initiative? </strong>
<br>The One-Stop Payroll initiative is a joint effort by the Inland Revenue
Authority of Singapore (IRAS), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB),
the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Government Technology Agency (GovTech).
The initiative aims to streamline and simplify the employer-related regulatory
requirements for businesses. Previously, businesses manually submitted
similar information via different means to respective agencies. With One-Stop
Payroll, businesses can submit employers’ employment and income-related
information to multiple agencies through a single platform, via their payroll
software. This includes the annual submission of salary data (under Auto-Inclusion
Scheme) to IRAS, monthly submission of employees’ CPF contributions to
CPFB, and responses to the Occupational Employment Dataset and labour market
surveys administered by MOM. As a result, this reduces administrative overheads
and eases adherence to employer-related regulatory obligations.

<p><strong>What are the key objectives of the One-Stop Payroll initiative? </strong>
<br>The main goals of the One-Stop Payroll initiative are to make employer-related
regulatory requirements easier and more consistent for businesses using
payroll software, thereby reducing administrative overheads. By integrating
payroll services these employer-related regulatory requirements seamlessly
into a single, convenient “one-stop” platform within the payroll software’s
natural systems, the initiative aims to boost operational efficiency and
help businesses and employers manage payroll more effectively.

<li>
<p><strong>How will the One-Stop Payroll initiative benefit businesses and employers? </strong>
<br>The One-Stop Payroll initiative simplifies the process by integrating
core filing obligations within the payroll software that businesses already
use, reducing the time and effort needed to meet regulatory obligations.
This also helps to ensure greater accuracy and reduces the need for employers
to reach out to agencies for assistance. Additionally, it enables easy
compliance and has the potential to streamline filing frequencies to agencies
in the long term.
