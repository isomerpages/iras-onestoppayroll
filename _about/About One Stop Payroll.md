<h1>About One-Stop Payroll</h1>
<p>The One-Stop Payroll initiative is a joint effort by the Inland Revenue
Authority of Singapore (IRAS), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB),
the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Government Technology Agency (GovTech).
The initiative aims to streamline and simplify the payroll-related regulatory
requirements for businesses and employers.</p>
<p>Currently, businesses are required to submit similar income and employment-related
information to respective agencies. This includes the annual submission
of salary data (under Auto-Inclusion Scheme) to IRAS, monthly submission
of CPF contributions to CPFB, and responses to the Occupational Employment
Dataset and labour market surveys administered by MOM. These submissions
are done separately via different means, ranging from digital services
or online forms, which require manual preparation.</p>

<p>With One-Stop Payroll, businesses can make these submissions to IRAS,
CPFB, and MOM through a single platform, seamlessly via their payroll software.
As a result, this significantly reduces administrative overheads and eases
compliance costs of payroll-related regulatory obligations.</p>
