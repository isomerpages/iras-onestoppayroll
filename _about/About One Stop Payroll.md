<h1>About One-Stop Payroll</h1>
<p>The One-Stop Payroll initiative is a joint effort by the Inland Revenue
Authority of Singapore (IRAS), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB),
the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Government Technology Agency (GovTech).
The initiative aims to streamline and simplify the payroll-related regulatory
requirements for businesses and employers.</p>
<p>Previously, businesses manually submitted similar information via different
means to respective agencies. With One-Stop Payroll, businesses can submit
employers’ employment and income-related information to multiple agencies
through a single platform, via their payroll software. This includes the
annual submission of salary data (under Auto-Inclusion Scheme) to IRAS,
monthly submission of employees’ CPF contributions to CPFB, and responses
to the Occupational Employment Dataset and labour market surveys administered
by MOM. As a result, this reduces administrative overheads and eases adherence
to payroll-related regulatory obligations.</p>
