### **One-Stop Payroll FAQs**

1.	What is the One-Stop Payroll initiative?
The One-Stop Payroll initiative is a joint effort by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB), the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Government Technology Agency (GovTech). The initiative aims to streamline and simplify the payroll process for businesses. 
Previously, businesses manually submitted similar information to agencies during different periods of the year. With One-Stop Payroll, businesses can submit employers’ employment and wage-related information to multiple agencies through their payroll software. This includes the annual submission of salary data (under Auto-Inclusion Scheme) to IRAS, monthly submission of employees’ CPF contributions to CPFB, and responses to the Occupational Employment Dataset and labour market surveys administered by MOM. As a result, this reduces administrative workload and encourages adherence to payroll-related regulatory obligations.

2.	What are the key objectives of the One-Stop Payroll initiative?
The main goals of the One-Stop Payroll initiative are to make payroll processes easier and more consistent for businesses using payroll software, reduce administrative workload, and encourage adherence to payroll-related regulatory obligations. By consolidating payroll services into a single, convenient “one-stop” platform, the initiative aims to boost operational efficiency and help businesses and employers manage payroll more effectively. 

3.	How will the One-Stop Payroll initiative benefit businesses and employers?
The One-Stop Payroll initiative offers several benefits for businesses and employers. Firstly, it simplifies the process by integrating core filing obligations within the payroll software that businesses already use, reducing the time and effort needed to meet regulatory obligations. This also helps to ensure greater accuracy and reduces the need for employers to reach out to agencies for assistance. Additionally, it enables easy compliance and has the potential to streamline filing frequencies to agencies in the long term.

 
4.	What is the product in the One-Stop Payroll initiative?
CPFB, IRAS and MOM provide the following submission APIs on GovTech’s centralised APEX  platform, that are available to software developers and partners for integration in their payroll software:
Product	CPFB’s CPF Contributions API	IRAS’ Employment Income API	MOM’s Workforce Statistics API
Overview	Employers are required to submit monthly CPF contributions (and other data) for their employees to CPFB. This API enables employers to make such submissions direct from payroll software.	Employers with more than 5 employees are required to submit yearly employment income information electronically to IRAS under the Auto Inclusion Scheme (AIS). This is to automatically include the income in employees’ personal income tax returns. This API enables employers to file required forms under the AIS and send associated data (salary, bonus, CPF, etc.) to IRAS seamlessly.	Employers are required under the Statistics Act to report changes in their workforce composition to MOM under the Occupational Employment Dataset (OED), as well as complete quarterly Labour Market Surveys (LMS). This API enables employers to report OED and LMS data directly from their payroll software.
